## 🔧 CRM System Setup

### Prerequisites
- PHP 7.4+ with SQLite support
- Web server (Apache/Nginx) or PHP's built-in server
- Write permissions for the `podcast-crm/data` directory

### Step 1: Initial Setup
1. Navigate to `https://yourdomain.com/podcast-crm/setup.php`
2. Enter your desired admin password
3. Copy the generated password hash
4. Edit `podcast-crm/config/config.php` and update the hash
5. **Delete `setup.php` for security**

### Step 2: Configuration
Edit `podcast-crm/config/config.php`:

```php
// Admin credentials
define('ADMIN_USERNAME', 'admin');
define('ADMIN_PASSWORD_HASH', 'your_generated_hash_here');

// RSS Feed (already configured)
define('RSS_FEED_URL', 'https://feeds.transistor.fm/the-muslim-non-profit-show');

// Optional: YouTube API
define('YOUTUBE_API_KEY', 'your-api-key');
define('YOUTUBE_CHANNEL_ID', 'your-channel-id');
```

### Step 3: Access Admin Panel
- URL: `https://yourdomain.com/podcast-crm/` (redirects to admin panel)
- Or directly: `https://yourdomain.com/podcast-crm/admin/`
- Default username: `admin`
- Password: What you set in setup

## 📝 Using the CRM

### Adding Episodes Manually

1. Login to the admin panel
2. Click "New Episode"
3. Fill in episode details:
   - Title, Description, Guest info
   - YouTube ID (from URL: `youtube.com/watch?v=ABC123` → `ABC123`)
   - Audio URL (from your podcast host)
   - Tags and key takeaways
4. Save as "Draft" or "Published"
5. Click "Export All" to update the website

### Importing from RSS Feed

2. The system will import new episodes from your RSS feed
3. Edit imported episodes to add missing details
4. Change status from "draft" to "published"
5. Click "Export All" to update the website

### Featured Episodes
- Only one episode can be featured at a time
- The featured episode appears prominently on the homepage
- Check "Featured" when editing an episode

## 🔐 Security & Accounts

### Default Account

- Password: `admin123` (CHANGE THIS IMMEDIATELY!)

### Changing Password
1. Login to admin panel
2. Click "Change Password"
3. Enter current and new password
4. Copy the generated hash
5. Update `podcast-crm/config/config.php` with the new hash

### Security Best Practices
- Change the default password immediately
- Use a strong password (minimum 8 characters)
- Keep `config/config.php` secure
- Delete `setup.php` after initial setup
- Regularly backup the SQLite database

## 🔄 How CRM Connects to Main Site

The CRM system manages episode data and exports it to `js/episodes.js`:

1. **Data Flow**:
   - Episodes stored in SQLite database
   - Admin panel for CRUD operations
   - Export function generates JavaScript file
   - Main site reads from `episodes.js`

2. **Automatic Updates**:
   - Click "Export All" to update the website
   - Or set up a cron job for automatic sync

3. **Episode Structure**:
   ```javascript
   {
     id: 1,
     title: "Episode Title",
     description: "Full description",
     guest: "Guest Name",
     guestTitle: "Guest Title",
     duration: "MM:SS",
     publishDate: "YYYY-MM-DD",
     youtubeId: "YouTube_ID",
     audioUrl: "https://audio.url",
     featured: true/false,
     tags: ["tag1", "tag2"],
     keyTakeaways: ["takeaway1", "takeaway2"]
   }
   ```

## 🚀 Deployment

### Static Hosting (Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages)
The main site is static and can be deployed anywhere:
```bash
# Just push to git
git add .
git commit -m "Update site"
git push origin main
```

### CRM Hosting Requirements
The CRM requires PHP hosting:
- Upload the entire `podcast-crm` folder
- Ensure PHP 7.4+ with SQLite
- Set write permissions on `data` directory
- Configure `.htaccess` for security

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Episodes Not Showing on Website
1. Check episode status is "published" in CRM
2. Click "Export All" in admin panel
3. Clear browser cache (or update cache-busting version in index.html)
4. Verify `js/episodes.js` was updated

### CRM Login Issues
1. Verify username/password
2. Check PHP session support
3. Ensure cookies are enabled
4. Try incognito/private browsing

### Database Errors
1. Check `podcast-crm/data` directory permissions
2. Verify SQLite PHP extension is enabled
3. Check error logs in `podcast-crm/data`
